# board-django
This is study project for inner course.
To install the DB, insert seed data and configure superuser run `install.sh`.
To run the project simpli execute `startup.sh` (or run with usual Django way).

## optional tasks:
1. Implemented polling feature at topic page.
2. Designed with bootstrap.
3. As for me, this task is too JS'y (but I will implement it if you ask, but you should know that my JS code is not so good. Look at `polling.js` file as example).
4. Basic shell scripts implemented.
